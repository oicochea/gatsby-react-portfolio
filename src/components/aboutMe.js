I devlope an interested in "coding" as I saw it before I became a software engineer while working as a database admnistrator along side "Programmers". I eventually got tired of hearing them say no we can't do it , so I embarked on this Journer. I can now say I am a Full stack Software Engineer.

My eventual goal is to become a project manager, by combining my skills I can create actionable plans that produce results. I am a goal driven individual who thrives on challenges and a team atmosphere. I strive to produce top level work as it is a representation of both my work ethic and a reflection on how I conduct myself.By bringing me into your team you're getting a bilingual software developer who can not only see day to day task but prepare actionable long term plans that fit the company's financial goals.
